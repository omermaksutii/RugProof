# /mythril — AI triage on top of Mythril

Mythril uses symbolic execution to find exploits. Powerful, but its output is dense and its false-positive rate is high. Rugproof: triage + turn symbolic findings into runnable PoCs.

## Prerequisites

`pip install mythril`.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Run Mythril

```bash
myth analyze <file> -o json
```

Capture issues, each with a SWC ID, severity, and a symbolic-execution path.

### Step 2 — For each Mythril issue

- Read the affected function.
- Look at the symbolic path Mythril provides.
- Turn the path into a **concrete Foundry test**:
  - Map symbolic vars to concrete inputs from Mythril's counter-example.
  - Set up state per the path.
  - Run the test via `forge-runner`.
- If the test passes (exploit succeeds) → True positive, output the PoC.
- If the test fails → either the path requires unreachable state, or the symbolic engine over-approximated. Mark as theoretical or FP.

### Step 3 — Output

```
Mythril + Rugproof triage:

  Mythril raw issues: 22
  After Rugproof triage:
    Concrete PoCs that pass:  4   (real bugs)
    Theoretical paths only:   12  (no realistic exploit)
    False positives:          6   (Mythril over-approximated)

Concrete PoCs:
  [SWC-107] Reentrancy in Vault.withdraw
    Mythril path:  attacker → withdraw → fallback re-enters withdraw
    Rugproof PoC:  test/exploits/ExploitMythril-SWC107.t.sol  (passes)
    Confidence:    HIGH
```

## Notes

- Mythril is slow on large contracts — warn the user upfront and offer to scope to one file.
- For modern Solidity (>=0.8), some classic SWCs (integer-overflow) are pre-handled — auto-downgrade those.
- Output should ALWAYS include a working test if confidence is HIGH.
